<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
The idea here is to calculate and display an aggregating particle.
In order to accomplish this, a modified random walk algorithm is used.
Initial spore(s) are randomly "seeded" in the center quarter of the screen.
Subsequent "spores" randomly enter a rectangular neighborhood of a seed
and "randomly walk" toward the seed. When within a pixel of a previously
existing spore, the new spore "sticks". I called the program "spore" 
because of the similar look to a mushroom spore print.
<P>
The colors in the image represent the "age" of spores. After N spores have
been "stuck", the color index is incremented.

<DT><B>Acknowledgements</B>
<DD>
The algorithm was derived from lectures given by Dietmar Saupe at the 
University of California at Santa Cruz. Assistance with colormaps and 
spinning color wheels and X was gleaned from Hiram Clawson and Stacey Campbell.

<DT><B>Build</B>
<DD>
To build the spore binary, either use the Imakefile or the sample makefile,
Makefile.std. If your system doesn't support prototypes, uncomment the 
PROTODEFINE line of the Imakefile.
<P>
After modifying the Imakefile appropriately, either use "xmkmf" or "imake"
to create a Makefile. Then just type "make" to compile spore.
<P>
The manual page can be formatted by typing "nroff -man spore.man > spore.1".

<DT><B>Install</B>
<DD>
To install spore, copy the spore binary to the desired location (the sample
makefile puts it in /usr/local/bin)
Copy the formatted man page to wherever you keep your local doc (i use
/usr/local/man/cat1 for imaging software), then add that location
to your MANPATH.

<DT><B>Verification</B>
<DD>
You can test spore by just invoking it with no arguments. It should display
a 512x480 image. Some workstations may be slow to calculate and display a
map as there are lots of calculations involved.
<P>
Some "interesting" ways to run spore are as follows :
<BR>
% spore -F -n 10 -d
<BR>
(use the full screen, calculate 10 maps in demo mode)
<BR>
% spore -R
<BR>
(display on the root window)
<BR>
% spore -o sporeprint.ppm
<BR>
(calculate and display with default parameters and save the resulting image
 as a PPM file called sporeprint.ppm. this can be viewed later using xv or 
 any PPM viewing utility)
